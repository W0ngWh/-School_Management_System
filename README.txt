1. The server that we used to develop the Pallas SMS is called the WAMP Server. 
get it here at:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/wampserver/

2. We included the database .sql file for the system. It can be found as
"sdp_db final.sql"

3. Please open phpMyAdmin in the Wamp server, then create a new database named:
"sdp_db". At the top of the page, go to the "Import" tab and import the 
SQL file.

4. The data in the database are all fictional and do not represent any individuals.
Any resemblance to real persons or other real-life entities is purely coincidental.

5. If there are any issues opening the files, please do not hesitate to contact
Ms. Lee Vin Nie at tp066529@mail.apu.edu.my.
